<p>Hello and Welcome!! My name is Wallace Hall.  I am delighted to be given the opportunity to teach here at Paulding County High School. I hope that our Information Technology courses equip students with the necessary tools needed to succeed in the 21st Century.  As business, technology and globalization transform our economy and civic sphere, educators must rise to the challenge of preparing students for an ever more complex and cognitively demanding world.  My challenge is to create assignments, projects and techniques to capture my students' attention. Projects should be technology-rich, highly engaging, and fun learning experiences that reflect real-world skills. I hope you enjoy your time in my class but what's most important, I hope you leave my classroom equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to be successful in life.  </p>
